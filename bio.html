I'm a cryptothematic data analyst, visualist, writer. I often share visualizations on <a
href="https://twitter.com/takenstheorem" target="_blank">ùïè</a>, on themes about time, scale, and
interconnectedness. A theme of my work has been the relationship between data and cultural contexts &mdash; and the exciting ways this relationship is being transformed by cryptographic and blockchain technology.<br /><br />

When entering the space several years ago, I created early
data interfaces for crypto projects, such as an early <a
href="https://opensea.io/blog/articles/predict-and-recommend-nfts" target="_blank">recommender system for
NFTs</a> in 2019. I developed experimental 100% on-chain and interactive NFT projects, such as <a
href="https://takenstheorem.medium.com/the-coin-f66bc3bfaae2" target="_blank">the_coin</a>, <a
href="https://takenstheorem.medium.com/gaussian-timepieces-9dc08cc8b344" target="_blank">Gaussian Timepieces</a>
and <a href="https://the-mesh.eth.limo" target="_blank">The Mesh</a>.<br><br>

My projects also include expressive data visualization, representing the structure and dynamics of raw on-chain
data: <a href="https://ethstory.eth.limo" target="_blank">Ethstory</a>, <a
href="https://opensea.io/collection/indivisuals-by-takens-theorem" target="_blank">Indivisuals</a>, and <a
href="https://knownorigin.io/collections/takenstheorem/reflective-recursion" target="_blank">Reflective
Recursion</a>.<br><br>

Several of these projects have had charitable fundraising goals, including for 501(c)(3) charities devoted to
helping communities most in need. Projects have raised over 60 ETH for charity (see donation section in Ethstory
and the_coin links below).<br><br>
