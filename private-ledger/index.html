                            night
                            before Intimate Systems released. The conversation seemed well suited as an explainer
                            itself,
                            illustrating the piece and how it works, because jonooo interacted with the contract and
                            participated as a "prover." I've adapted the questions and responses with permission below,
                            sharing the very visuals we shared along the way (keeping our secrets secret, of course).

                            <strong>Takens Theorem:</strong> Sure! Here's some material from the site, which I'll share
                            in
                            more detail soon. "Private Ledger" explores a divide between public and private. It invites
                            its
                            collector to formulate a zero-knowledge (ZK) proof which is then written to the public
                            ledger,
                            proving that a particular meaning exists. The collector can then alter a visual
                            representation
                            based on this proof, and anyone on the chain including I could confirm knowledge of it (if
                            the
                            collector chooses to share this hidden meaning with others).

                            <br><br>The public ledger indexes countless intimate secrets like this. Every gentle click
                            on a
                            hardware wallet could happen alongside hidden ideas and emotions that remain only in the
                            minds
                            of those involved - their "private ledger." The visual itself depicts this tension, a
                            structure
                            at the center accumulating with each proof, but the idea itself encoded in a kind of
                            organic,
                            undulating visual behind it.

                            inspired by related ideas about intimate secrets. There's also Paul Seidler's <em><a

                            information asymmetry among those observing the ledger - intimate secrets that the chain can
                            hold. "Private Ledger" is inspired by these kinds of ideas, they are technical of course but
                            they extend very intimate shared concepts and ideas sometimes private, obscured inside only
                            one

                            <strong>Takens Theorem:</strong> For Private Ledger, I used a beautiful ZK trick that
                            exploits
                            discrete log as
                            they call it - no fancy circuits which can be expensive for proofs - just modular
                            exponentiation
                            of
                            giant integers. Which isn't free but pretty cheap.

                            Ledger to illustrate a simple version of it (it's called the Sigma protocol with Schnorr
                            identification). There are all kinds of details in ZK math, it's incredible - you can prove
                            the
                            soundness of a method for example, certainty that an attacker could not break it. However

                            not a cryptographer, so any collector or viewer of the piece should be aware that this is a

                            simple version of the algorithm and should not be used for any real-world applications.

                            when the collector proves that their message exists on chain, the piece updates to that

                            <strong>Takens Theorem:</strong> The contract implements an interactive zero-knowledge
                            proof.
                            You have to take two steps, two transactions. The proof contract basically gives the
                            collector
                            (or other prover, like you) a challenge that numerically means, "Okay if you know how to get
                            that huge number from a secret, then integrate this challenge and come back with a valid
                            signature of that knowledge." Then the second transaction will write that proof to the
                            chain.

                            can propagate the ideas to others, who then become provers in their own right. The collector

                When transactions occur on chain, they are etched into a public ledger. Each transaction represents a
                commitment to a state change
                using galactically large integers. Cold compute.
            </p>

            <p>But there is another ledger, one that maps onto the chain but is kept separate, secret. This "private
                ledger" marks the human intentions behind transactions. Collecting NFTs exemplifies this dynamic. A
                private
                ledger captures the subjective meaning and emotional resonance that cannot so easily be encoded in code,
                existing in the space between intention and implementation. It's in mind.

                When a person interacts with the chain, the world contains these traces of intention, in memory and
                emotion. And so despite its cold compute, the public ledger indexes countless such intimate secrets.
                Every gentle click on a hardware wallet happens alongside hidden ideas and emotions that remain only in
                the minds of those involved -- their private ledger.

                <em>Private Ledger</em> lets its collector prove a meaning without revealing it.

            <p>
                "Private Ledger" by <a href="../takens-theorem.html">Takens Theorem</a> interrogates this divide between
                public and private. It invites its collector to formulate a zero-knowledge proof which is then written
                to the public ledger, proving that a particular meaning exists. The
                collector can then alter a visual representation based on this proof, and anyone on the chain including
                Takens can confirm it (should the collector choose to share this hidden meaning with others).

                Private Ledger is a 1/1 on-chain piece. It has two parts: (i) a cryptographic commitment and (ii) a
                dynamic
                visual representation of that proof.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cryptographic commitment</strong>, a permanent record that the message exists. It is a giant
                    integer over which the public ledger computes proof of a specific message's existence.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic visual encoding</strong>, an image that maps directly onto the proof's
                    values,
                    expressing the more fluid biological essence of the collector's intention. It resides on chain,
                    mapped to the message but not revealing the message itself.</li>

                <p>Private Ledger is an art project. An experiment. It cannot be considered a sound cryptographic system
                    for the purposes
                    of any important real-world information or private data. It is not a secure system and should not be
                    used for any sensitive information. It may have unexpected bugs or vulnerabilities. Indeed, that is
                    part of the expressive fun considered in the chat with jonooo shown above.

                    Anyone can generate a proof from any wallet, but only the collector's wallet can change the visual.
